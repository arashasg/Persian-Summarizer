### Links to Datasets Crawled and Used in this Project

There are several datasets we used to implement this Project. 
Previous studies implemented and introduced some of these datasets,
and our team members crawled some. 
The datasets contain news stories crawled from Persian news agency 
websites and summaries. The datasets can be easily downloaded using
the links below. 

We contributed to the community by crawling the AsrIran and Tasnim datasets. Both their raw and clean versions are accessible through the links below.
